### Hi, I'm Ali Obeid 👋

1st year CCE student — building toward **AI Engineering**.

Right now I'm focusing on mastering **Python** deeply and learning **Machine Learning** fundamentals. I don’t push random noise — I push only when I build something that is real, solid, and worth shipping.



### What I'm doing now

- Python mastery (craft + internals)
- ML fundamentals (math → code → intuition)
- building the foundation to become a strong AI engineer / future startup founder



### My direction

I want to build real world AI software + systems that actually get used — not just experiments.

My roadmap curve is:

**Python → ML fundamentals → AI engineering → AI powered products**

### What you will see on my GitHub

- clean, intentional repos (not spam)
- ML from scratch implementations
- notebooks exploring concepts deeply
- high quality small tools & experiments
- learning in public as I grow
